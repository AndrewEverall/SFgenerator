# SFgenerator
Creates a selection function given age, metallicity and mass for multifibre spectroscopic surveys.

This database contains the python scripts necessary in order to build a selection function for a multifibre spectroscopic survey from the data sample.

Within this database I will include: The selection function scripts and all dependencies, some premade selection functions for given surveys (such as RAVE, Lamost, Apogee, TGAS), the datasets used in the creation of these (2MASS, Vista).
